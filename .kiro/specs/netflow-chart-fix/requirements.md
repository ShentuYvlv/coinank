# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical bug in the NetFlowChart component where the chart displays "no data" message despite successfully fetching and processing data from the API. The issue occurs when users search for tokens, and while the data is retrieved correctly (as shown in console logs), the chart fails to render the visualization properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user searching for cryptocurrency data, I want the NetFlow chart to display the fetched data correctly, so that I can analyze the buy/sell flow patterns for any token.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for a token THEN the NetFlow chart SHALL display the fetched data without showing "no data" message
2. WHEN the NetFlow API returns valid data THEN the chart SHALL render all four data series (buy flow, sell flow, net flow, and price)
3. WHEN the chart receives data with 499+ data points THEN it SHALL display the visualization correctly without performance issues
4. IF the data arrays have different lengths (like timestamps: 499, prices: 498) THEN the chart SHALL handle the mismatch gracefully
5. WHEN the chart updates THEN it SHALL maintain proper scaling and axis formatting for all data series

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging chart issues, I want clear error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve rendering problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chart rendering fails THEN the system SHALL log specific error messages with context
2. WHEN data processing encounters issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed debugging information
3. IF ECharts fails to render THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful error message to the user
4. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL indicate which specific data arrays are problematic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing NetFlow charts, I want consistent and reliable chart rendering across different tokens, so that I can trust the data visualization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between different tokens THEN the chart SHALL render consistently for each token
2. WHEN the chart container resizes THEN the visualization SHALL adapt properly to the new dimensions
3. IF the chart data updates THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without flickering or "no data" states
4. WHEN multiple chart updates occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them without conflicts
